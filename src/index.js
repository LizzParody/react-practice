ReactDOM.render( //is what kicks off the rendering of our entire app, and it takes two parameters: some JSX to render and where to render it to.
    <Detail message="This is coming from props!" />, //it's the JSX name of our Detail component. When our app gets built, that <Detail /> line automatically gets converted into the Detail component we created inside Detail.js, which in turn has its render() method called so it draws to the screen.
    document.getElementById('app')// it tells React we want it to render inside the HTML element named "app" â€“ that's inside the index.html file we made earlier.
